# Handwash-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision

This project was developed to complete a Data driven AI assigment for the university of Huddersfield. The code writeup is within the notebook file. The AI was trained on crowd sourced dataset from students the dataset was low quality due to how students interprited the rules on how to take the picutres creating a low quality dataset which had to be heavly pre processed for get somewhat decent prediction results. However if you want the dataset for yourself please reach out to me via email and I can sent it to you.
